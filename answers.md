# What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

It pauses the application and launches the debug console so you can check the state of certain variables to see where the problem lies.

# Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

Not immediately.

# How do we debug the next line of code?

We can use the "Step over" option.

# What does the step into command do?

If the breakpoint is on a line which calls a function you can drill down into the function to see where the problem lies.

# What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluate expression enables you to enter an expression and discover what value it would give at the breakpoint.
Evaluate code fragment enables you to enter a longer segment of code so you can, for instance, declare and assign values to variables.
